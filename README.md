Rainbowduino-FishOfWatorSimulation
==================================

This is a Fish of Wator simulation for a Rainbowduino 3D LED light cube. 

The code executes once the cube is powered by either a micro USB connection or a power connector in the back and continues to run until the power is disconnected. 

The code is designed to run on an Aruino Duemilanove or Nano w/ ATmega328 aruino board running at 8MHz with a maximum sketch size of 30,720 bytes.

This application was written with the official Arduino compiler provided with the Rainbowduino board. The Rainbowduino library and compiler version are 23 - other versions may not upload to the board and will throw compilation errors.
